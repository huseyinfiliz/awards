#### Scoring System

  - **Points**: Users earn **1 point** for every correct prediction.

  - **Ranking**: The leaderboard is sorted by Total Points (primary) and Correct Pick count (secondary).

  - **Make picks**: Allows users to participate in the game.

#### Automated Logic

  - **Result Calculation**: When an admin enters the score, the system automatically determines the winner (Home/Away/Draw).
